# Architecture

Though most of this manual covers how to create your own classes in li3 (controllers, models,
and the like), you may want to familiarize yourself with some of the basic architectural ideas
and philosophies behind the framework. As you come to know the code—and start to build plugins
and extensions—keeping additions in style with li3's architecture becomes important.

This guide explains some of the ideas and practices behind how li3 is put together, at a
fundamental level. Inspecting the core libraries will make much more sense after understanding
the principles outlined here.
